 ⚖️ Limited Scalability – Human counselors can’t efficiently cater to large, diverse audiences.


 

 🕒 Outdated Industry Insights – Guidance is rarely aligned with real-time job market trends.

 

 📄 Career Prep Gaps – Inadequate support for essential job-readiness components like resume building, cover letters, and interview preparation.
